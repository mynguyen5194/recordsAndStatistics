 * This program keeps records and performs statistical analysis for a class
 * of students (40 or less). There are five quizzes during the term. Each
 * student is identified by a four-Â­digit student ID number. The program will
 * read the file named "records.txt", which includes students' records. It
 * then prints the data and computes the statistics for each quiz.
